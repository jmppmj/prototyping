# Wireframes and Prototypes
Low, medium, and high-fidelity wireframes and prototypes.
***
- **Low-fidelity**: 
  - Simple, often hand-drawn, representation of a design or concept.
  - Used to quickly get an idea across without focusing on the fine details or functionality.

- **Medium-fidelity**: 
  - More detailed than low-fidelity, but not fully functional.
  - Might be digital and have some interactive elements, but not all the features of the final product.

- **High-fidelity**:
  - Detailed and interactive representation of the final product.
  - Looks and functions very closely to how the final product will.
